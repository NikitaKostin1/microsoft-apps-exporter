# Microsoft Apps Exporter

## Overview

This project was initiated by a company with a strong reliance on Microsoft applications. The proposed solution is engineered to integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture. The Microsoft Apps Exporter project addresses the need for a dynamic and scalable solution to export applications data to a production database without manual intervention. This solution ensures efficient data handling, automation, and adaptability to evolving business requirements.

### Architecture
- Built with **Go**, providing a high-performance API layer and webhook handler for integration with external services.
- Communicates with **Microsoft Graph API** for data synchronization and subscription management.
- Uses **PostgreSQL** for relational data storage, suitable with **ClickHouse**.
- Fully **Dockerized** for portability and environment consistency across all stages.
- Deployed on **Kubernetes**, orchestrated via **Helm**, with manifests linted and managed through **ArgoCD** for **GitOps**-based delivery.
- **CI/CD pipeline** powered by **GitLab CI**. It runs **charts and yaml linting**, comprehensive **unit and integration tests**, builds **docker and helm packages** and pushes to remote registries.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing **real-time monitoring and alerts**.
- Extend the exporter to integrate with other Microsoft applications.
- Optimizing **batch processing** for high-volume data.
- Queue and **retry deliveries** using backoff strategies or persistent job queues (e.g., **Redis**, **NATS**).
- Secure administrative endpoints using **RBAC** with integration to Microsoft Entra ID.
- Implement **Kafka** workers that consume sync tasks or webhook events from a shared queue (**NATS**, **RabbitMQ**), allowing the system to **scale horizontally**.
- Provide optional export connectors to push synced data to external systems like: **Snowflake**, **BigQuery**, **ElasticSearch**, **S3**.

This project is actively evolving, and feedback is highly valued to ensure it meets the business requirements effectively!
